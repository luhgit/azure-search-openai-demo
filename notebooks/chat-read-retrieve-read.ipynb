      "Generated answer: To reduce vibrations and prevent the appliance from moving, you can align the appliance correctly. First, loosen the lock nuts using a WAF 17 wrench by turning it in a clockwise direction. Then, turn the appliance feet to align it and check that all appliance feet stand firmly on the ground using a spirit level. Finally, screw the lock nuts tightly against the housing using a WAF 17 wrench. Remember to hold the foot tight and not adjust its height while doing so. [WUU28TA8_en-us_washing machine-14.pdf]\n",

Then, turn the appliance feet to align it and check that all appliance feet stand firmly on the ground using a spirit level. Finally, screw the lock nuts tightly against the housing using a WAF 17 wrench. Remember to hold the foot tight and not adjust its height while doing so. [WUU28TA8_en-us_washing machine-14.pdf]\n"
