These products contain not only de- tergent but also rinse aid and salt re- placement substances (3in1) and, depending on the combination (4in1, 5in1, ...), additional components such as glass protection or stainless steel cleaner.According to the manufacturers, combined detergents generally only function up to a water hardness of 26 °E. With a water hardness above 26 °E you will need to add special salt and rinse aid. For the best wash- ing and drying results we recom- mend using special salt and rinse aid from a water hardness of 17 °E.

These products contain not only de- tergent but also rinse aid and salt re- placement substances (3in1) and, depending on the combination (4in1, 5in1, ...), additional components such as glass protection or stainless steel cleaner.According to the manufacturers, combined detergents generally only function up to a water hardness of 26 °E. With a water hardness above 26 °E you will need to add special salt and rinse aid. For the best wash- ing and drying results we recom- mend using special salt and rinse aid from a water hardness of 17 °E. If you are using combined detergent, the washing programme is adjusted automatically to ensure the best pos- sible washing and drying result.\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Ich habe eine Frage.
